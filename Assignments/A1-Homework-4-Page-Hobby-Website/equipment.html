					<h1>Camera</h1>
					<p>Invest in a camera.</p>

					<p>This is the natural progression from using an iPhone or laptop to film your video. There are tons of options, but we’ve found a high ROI and love the end results from the Canon SL1.</p>

					<p>When you buy a better camera, you’ll also want to buy a tripod to match.</p>

					<h2>Mircrophone</h2>

					<p>Invest in a microphone</p>

					<p>Sure, hanging an iPhone from the ceiling with fishing line might make for a quick microphone fix and good story, but it’s easily trumped by an affordable and higher quality microphone that instantly takes your videos to the next level.</p>

					<p>For less than $150 you can upgrade to a Rode. It’s a product I use and love and it easily plugs into your computer.</p>
